This is a basic like button I made for playing with code :) <br/>
Try changing "likes + 1" to "likes + 3". <br/>
Then click on the heart. <br/>
Have fun with inline styles if your feeling it.

```jsx react-live
function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, increaseLikes] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "22px", color: "purple" }}>{likes} likes</p>

      <button
        className={"like-button"}
        onClick={() => increaseLikes(likes + 1)}
      >
        <span role={"img"} aria-label={"gold heart"}>
          ðŸ’›
        </span>
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```
